Your phone number and credit card are used only to verify your identity, and your credit card will not be billed.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Your phone number and credit card details are used only to verify your identity. Although your credit card won’t be charged, Microsoft will place an authorization hold on it for a minimal amount to verify that the credit card is valid. The hold will be released within 3-5 business days, depending on your financial institution’s policies.
