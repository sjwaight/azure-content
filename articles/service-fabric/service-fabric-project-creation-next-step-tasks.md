# Your Service Fabric application and next steps
Your Service Fabric application has been created. This article describes the makeup of your project and some potential next steps.

## Your application
Every new application includes an application project. There may be one or two additional projects depending on the type of service chosen.

### The application project
The application project consists of:

- A set of references to the Services that make up your application.

- Two publish profiles (Local and Cloud) that you can use to maintain preferences for working with different environments, such as a cluster endpoint and whether to perform upgrade deployments by default.

- Two application parameter files (Local and Cloud) that you can use to maintain environment-specific application configurations, such as the number of partitions to create for a service.

- A deployment script that you can use to deploy your application from the command line or as part of an automated continuous integration pipeline.

- The application manifest, which describes the application.

### Reliable Services
When you add a new Reliable Service, Visual Studio adds a service project to your solution. The service project contains a class that extends from either `StatelessService` or `StatefulService` depending on the type you chose.

### Reliable Actors
When you add a new Reliable Actor, Visual Studio adds two projects to your solution: an actor project and interface project.

The actor project defines the actor type and (for stateful actors) its state. The interface project provides an interface that other services can use to invoke the actor.

Note that actor projects do not contain any default startup behavior as actors must be activated by other services. Consider adding a reliable service or ASP.NET project to create and interact with your actors.

### ASP.NET 5
The ASP.NET 5 templates provided for use in Service Fabric applications are almost identical to those available for ASP.NET 5 projects created independently. The only differences are:

- The project contains a **PackageRoot** folder for storing the ServiceManifest along with Data and Config packages.

- The project references an additional NuGet package (Microsoft.ServiceFabric.AspNet.Hosting), which acts as a bridge between DNX and Service Fabric.

## Next steps
### Add a web front-end to your application
Service Fabric provides integration with ASP.NET 5 for building web-based entry points to your application. See [Adding a web front-end to your application][add-web-frontend] to learn how to create a REST interface based on ASP.NET WebAPI.

### Create an Azure cluster
The Service Fabric SDK provides a local cluster for development and testing. To create a cluster in Azure, see [Setting up a Service Fabric Cluster from the Azure Portal][create-cluster-in-portal]

### Publish your application to Azure
You can publish your application directly from Visual Studio to an Azure cluster. To learn how, see [Publishing your application to Azure][publish-app-to-azure].

### Use Service Fabric Explorer to visualize your cluster
Service Fabric Explorer offers an easy way to visual your cluster, including deployed applications and physical layout. To learn, see [Visualizing your cluster using Service Fabric Explorer][visualize-with-sfx].

### Version and upgrade your services
Service Fabric enables independent versioning and upgrade of independent services in an application. To learn more, see [Versioning and upgrading your services][app-upgrade-tutorial].

### Configure continuous integration with Visual Studio Online
To learn how you can set up a continuous integration process for your Service Fabric application, see [Configure continuous integration with Visual Studio Online][ci-with-vso].
