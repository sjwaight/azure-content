# Deploy, upgrade, test, and remove Service Fabric applications using PowerShell

This article shows you how to use PowerShell to automate common tasks for deploying, upgrading, removing, and testing Service Fabric applications.  

## Prerequisites

Before moving on to the tasks in the article, be sure to [Install the runtime, SDK, and tools](service-fabric-get-started.md) which also installs the ServiceFabric and ServiceFabricTestability PowerShell modules. [Enable PowerShell script execution](service-fabric-get-started.md#enable-powershell-script-execution) and also [Install and start a local cluster](service-fabric-get-started.md#install-and-start-a-local-cluster) so you can run the examples in the article.

The examples in this article use the [HelloWorldStateful sample application](https://github.com/Azure/servicefabric-samples/tree/master/samples/Services/VS2015/HelloWorldStateful). Download and build the sample application.

Before running any PowerShell commands in this article, first connect to the local Service Fabric cluster using [Connect-ServiceFabricCluster](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt125938.aspx):

```powershell
Connect-ServiceFabricCluster
```

## TASK: Deploy a Service Fabric application

After you've built the application and the application type has been packaged, you can deploy the application into a local Service Fabric cluster. First, package the HelloWorldStateful application in Visual Studio by right-clicking on **HelloWorldStatefulApplication** in Solution Explorer and selecting **Package**.  See [Model an application in Service Fabric](service-fabric-application-model.md) for information on the service and application manifests and the package layout.  Deployment involves uploading the application package, registering the application type, and creating the application instance. Use the instructions in this section to deploy a new application to a cluster.

### Step 1: Upload the application package
Uploading the application package to the ImageStore puts it in a location accessible by internal Service Fabric components.  The application package contains the necessary application manifest, service manifest(s), and code/config/data package(s) to create the application and service instances.  The [Copy-ServiceFabricApplicationPackage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt125905.aspx) command will upload the package. For example:

```powershell
Copy-ServiceFabricApplicationPackage C:\ServiceFabricSamples\Services\VS2015\HelloWorldStateful\HelloWorldStatefulApplication\pkg\Debug -ImageStoreConnectionString fabric:ImageStore -ApplicationPackagePathInImageStore HelloWorldStateful
```

### Step 2: Register the application type
Registering the application package makes the application type and version declared in the application manifest available for use. The system will read the package uploaded in the previous step, verify the package (equivalent to running [Test-ServiceFabricApplicationPackage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt125950.aspx) locally), process the package contents, and copy the processed package to an internal system location.  Run the [Register-ServiceFabricApplicationType](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt125958.aspx) cmdlet:

```powershell
Register-ServiceFabricApplicationType HelloWorldStateful
```
To see the application types registered in the cluster, run the cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-ServiceFabricApplicationType
```

### Step 3: Create the application instance
An application can be instantiated using any application type version that has been registered successfully using the [New-ServiceFabricApplication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt125913.aspx) command. The name of each application must start with the **fabric:** scheme and be unique for each application instance. The application type name and application type version are declared in the ApplicationManifest.xml file. If there were any default services defined in the application manifest of the target application type, then those will also be created at this time.

```powershell
New-ServiceFabricApplication fabric:/HelloWorldStatefulApplication HelloWorldStatefulApplication 1.0.0.0
```

The [Get-ServiceFabricApplication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt163515.aspx) command lists all applications instances that were successfully created along with their overall status. The [Get-ServiceFabricService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt125889.aspx) command lists all service instances that were successfully created within a given application instance. Default services (if any) will be listed.

```powershell
Get-ServiceFabricApplication

Get-ServiceFabricApplication | Get-ServiceFabricService
```

## TASK: Upgrade a Service Fabric application

You can upgrade a previously deployed Service Fabric application.  This task upgrades the HelloWorldStateful application that was deployed in TASK: Deploy a Service Fabric application. Read through [Application Upgrade](service-fabric-application-upgrade.md) for additional information.

### Step 1: Update the application

Make changes to the code in the HelloWorldStateful service.

After updating the service code you'll need to increment the service version number in the ServiceManifest.xml file (located in the PackageRoot directory of the HelloWorldStateful project). Find the **CodePackage** element of the manifest and change the service version to 2.0.0.0.  The corresponding lines in the ServiceManifest.xml file should look like the following:

```xml
<ServiceManifest Name="HelloWorldStatefulPkg"
                 Version="2.0.0.0"
                 xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric"
                 xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
                 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

<CodePackageName="Code" Version="2.0.0.0">
```

Now, you'll need to update the ApplicationManifest.xml file (found under the HelloWorldStatefulApplication project under the HelloWorldStateful solution).  Update the **ServiceManifestRef** element to use version 2.0.0.0 of the HelloWorldStatefulPkg project. Also update the **ApplicationTypeVersion** to 2.0.0.0 from 1.0.0.0. The corresponding lines in ApplicationManifest.xml should read:

```xml
<ApplicationManifest ApplicationTypeName="HelloWorldStatefulApplication" ApplicationTypeVersion="2.0.0.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

<ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="HelloWorldStatefulPkg" ServiceManifestVersion="2.0.0.0" />
```

After making these changes save the files and rebuild the HelloWorldStateful project. Now package the updated application by right clicking on the HelloWorldStatefulApplication project, selecting the Service Fabric Menu and choosing Package. This should create an application package that can be deployed. Your updated application is ready to be deployed now.

### Step 2: Copy and register the updated application package

The application is now built, packaged, and ready to be upgraded. If you open up a PowerShell window as administrator and type [Get-ServiceFabricApplication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt163515.aspx), you should see that Application Type 1.0.0.0 of **HelloWorldStatefulApplication** is deployed.  For the HelloWorldStateful sample, the application package is found in: *C:\ServiceFabricSamples\Services\VS2015\HelloWorldStateful\HelloWorldStatefulApplication\pkg\Debug*.

Now copy the updated application package to the Service Fabric ImageStore (where the application packages are stored by Service Fabric). The parameter *ApplicationPackagePathInImageStore* informs Service Fabric where it can find the application package. The following command will copy the application package to *HelloWorldStatefulV2* in the ImageStore:  

```powershell
Copy-ServiceFabricApplicationPackage  -ApplicationPackagePath C:\ServiceFabricSamples\Services\VS2015\HelloWorldStateful\HelloWorldStatefulApplication\pkg\Debug -ImageStoreConnectionString fabric:ImageStore -ApplicationPackagePathInImageStore HelloWorldStatefulV2
```

The next step is to register the new version of the application with Service Fabric, which can be performed using the [Register-ServiceFabricApplicationType](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt125958.aspx) cmdlet:

```powershell
Register-ServiceFabricApplicationType -ApplicationPathInImageStore HelloWorldStatefulV2
```

If this command doesn't succeed you may need to rebuild the service, as mentioned in Step 1.

### Step 3: Start the upgrade
Various upgrade parameters, timeouts, and health criterion can be applied to application upgrades. Read through [application upgrade parameters](service-fabric-application-upgrade-parameters.md) and [upgrade process](service-fabric-application-upgrade.md) to learn more. For this walkthrough, leave the service health evaluation criterion set to the default (and recommended values). All services and instances should be _healthy_ after the upgrade.  However, increase the *HealthCheckStableDuration* to 60 seconds (so that the services will be healthy for at least 20 seconds before the upgrade proceeds to the next upgrade domain).  Also set the *UpgradeDomainTimeout* to be 1200 seconds and the *UpgradeTimeout* to be 3000 seconds. Finally, set the *UpgradeFailureAction* to rollback which requests that Service Fabric rollback the application to the previous version if failures are encountered during upgrade.

You can now start the application upgrade using the [Start-ServiceFabricApplicationUpgrade](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt125975.aspx) cmdlet:

```powershell
Start-ServiceFabricApplicationUpgrade -ApplicationName fabric:/HelloWorldStatefulApplication -ApplicationTypeVersion 2.0.0.0 -HealthCheckStableDurationSec 60 -UpgradeDomainTimeoutSec 1200 -UpgradeTimeout 3000  -FailureAction Rollback -Monitored
```

Note the application name is the same as the previously deployed v1.0.0.0 application name (fabric:/HelloWorldStatefulApplication). Service Fabric uses this name to identify which application is getting upgraded. If you set the timeouts to be too short, you may encounter a time out failure message that states the problem. Refer to [Troubleshoot application upgrades](service-fabric-application-upgrade-troubleshooting.md), or increase the timeouts.

You can monitor application upgrade progress using [Service Fabric Explorer](service-fabric-visualizing-your-cluster.md), or using the [Get-ServiceFabricApplicationUpgrade](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt125988.aspx) cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-ServiceFabricApplicationUpgrade fabric:/HelloWorldStatefulApplication
```

In a few minutes, [Get-ServiceFabricApplicationUpgrade](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt125988.aspx) cmdlet should show that all upgrade domains were upgraded (completed).

## TASK: Test a Service Fabric application

In order to write high quality services, developers need to be able to induce unreliable infrastructure faults to test the stability of their services. Service Fabric gives developers the ability to induce fault actions and test services in the presence of failures using the chaos and failover test scenarios.  Read through [Testability Overview](service-fabric-testability-overview.md) for additional information.

### Step 1: Run the chaos test scenario
The chaos scenario generates faults across the entire Service Fabric cluster. The scenario compresses faults generally seen in months or years to a few hours. The combination of interleaved faults with the high fault rate finds corner cases which are otherwise missed. The following example runs the chaos test scenario for 60 minutes.

```powershell
$timeToRun = 60
$maxStabilizationTimeSecs = 180
$concurrentFaults = 3
$waitTimeBetweenIterationsSec = 60

Connect-ServiceFabricCluster

Invoke-ServiceFabricChaosTestScenario -TimeToRunMinute $timeToRun -MaxClusterStabilizationTimeoutSec $maxStabilizationTimeSecs -MaxConcurrentFaults $concurrentFaults -EnableMoveReplicaFaults -WaitTimeBetweenIterationsSec $waitTimeBetweenIterationsSec
```

### Step 2: Run the failover test scenario
The Failover test scenario targets a specific service partition, instead of the entire cluster, and leaves other services unaffected. The scenario iterates through a sequence of simulated faults and service validation while your business logic runs. A failure in service validation indicates an issue that needs further investigation. The Failover test only induces one fault at a time, as opposed to the Chaos test scenario which can induce multiple faults.  The following example runs the Failover test for 60 minutes against the fabric:/HelloWorldStatefulApplication/HelloWorldStateful service.

```powershell
$timeToRun = 60
$maxStabilizationTimeSecs = 180
$waitTimeBetweenFaultsSec = 10
$serviceName = "fabric:/HelloWorldStatefulApplication/HelloWorldStateful"

Connect-ServiceFabricCluster

Invoke-ServiceFabricFailoverTestScenario -TimeToRunMinute $timeToRun -MaxServiceStabilizationTimeoutSec $maxStabilizationTimeSecs -WaitTimeBetweenFaultsSec $waitTimeBetweenFaultsSec -ServiceName $serviceName -PartitionKindUniformInt64 -PartitionKey 1
```

## TASK: Remove a Service Fabric application
You can delete an instance of a deployed application, remove the provisioned application type from the cluster, and remove the application package from the ImageStore.

### Step 1: Remove an application instance
When an application instance is no longer needed, you can permanently remove it using the [Remove-ServiceFabricApplication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt125914.aspx) cmdlet. This will automatically remove all services belonging to the application as well, permanently removing all service state. This operation cannot be reversed and application state cannot be recovered.

```powershell
Remove-ServiceFabricApplication fabric:/HelloWorldStatefulApplication
```

### Step 2: Unregister the application type
When you no longer need a particular version of an application type, unregister it using the [Unregister-ServiceFabricApplicationType](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt125885.aspx) cmdlet. Unregistering unused types will release storage space used by the application package in the Image Store. An application type can be unregistered as long as there are no applications instantiated against it or pending application upgrades referencing it.

```powershell
Unregister-ServiceFabricApplicationType HelloWorldStatefulApplication 1.0.0.0
```

### Step 3: Remove the application package
After the application type is unregistered the application package can be removed from the ImageStore using the [Remove-ServiceFabricApplicationPackage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt163532.aspx) cmdlet.

```powershell
Remove-ServiceFabricApplicationPackage -ImageStoreConnectionString fabric:ImageStore -ApplicationPackagePathInImageStore HelloWorldStateful
```
