# Managing application parameters for multiple environments

Service Fabric clusters can be formed using anywhere from one to many thousands of machines. While application binaries can run without modification across this wide spectrum of environments, you will often wish to configure the application differently depending on the number of machines you're deploying to.

As a simple example, consider the `InstanceCount` for a stateless service. When running in Azure, you will generally want to set this paramater to the special value of -1, ensuring that your service is running on every node in the cluster. This configuration is not suitable for a one-box cluster, however, since you can't have multiple processes listening on the same endpoint on a single machine. Instead, you will typically set the `InstanceCount` to 1.

## Specifying environment-specific parameters

The solution to this is a set of parameterized default services and application parameters files that fill in those parameter values for a given environment.

### Default services

Service Fabric applications are made up of a collection of service instances. While it is possible to create an empty application and then create all service instances dynamically, most applications have a set of core services that should always be created when the application is instantiated. These are referred to as "default services" and are specified in the application manifest, with placeholders for per-environment configuration included in spare brackets:

    <DefaultServices>
        <Service Name="Stateful1">
            <StatefulService
                ServiceTypeName="Stateful1Type" TargetReplicaSetSize="[Stateful1_TargetReplicaSetSize]" MinReplicaSetSize="[Stateful1_MinReplicaSetSize]">

                <UniformInt64Partition
                    PartitionCount="[Stateful1_PartitionCount]" LowKey="-9223372036854775808"
                    HighKey="9223372036854775807"
                />
        </StatefulService>
    </Service>
  </DefaultServices>

Each of the named parameters must defined within the Parameters element of the application manifest:

    <Parameters>
        <Parameter Name="Stateful1_MinReplicaSetSize" DefaultValue="2" />
        <Parameter Name="Stateful1_PartitionCount" DefaultValue="1" />
        <Parameter Name="Stateful1_TargetReplicaSetSize" DefaultValue="3" />
    </Parameters>

The DefaultValue attributes specifies the value to be used in the absence of a more specific parameter for a given environment.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Not all service instance parameters are suitable for per-environment configuration. In the example above, the LowKey and HighKey values for the service's partitioning scheme are explicitly defined for all instances of the service since the partition range is a function of your data domain, not of the environment.

### Per-environment service configuration settings

The [Service Fabric application model](service-fabric-application-model.md) enables services to include configuration packages containing custom key-value pairs readable at runtime. The values of these settings can also be differentiated by environment by specifying a `ConfigOverride` in the application manifest.

Suppose that you have the following setting in the service manifest for the `Stateful1` service:


    <Section Name="MyConfigSection">
      <Parameter Name="MaxQueueSize" Value="25" />
    </Section>

To override this value for a specific application/environment pair, create a `ConfigOverride` when importing the service manifest in the application manifest.

    <ConfigOverrides>
     <ConfigOverride Name="Config">
        <Settings>
           <Section Name="MyConfigSection">
              <Parameter Name="MaxQueueSize" Value="[Stateful1_MaxQueueSize]" />
           </Section>
        </Settings>
     </ConfigOverride>
  </ConfigOverrides>

This parameter can then be configured by environment as shown above, by declaring it in the parameters section of the application manifest and specifying environment-specific values in the application parameters files.

>[AZURE.NOTE] In the case of service configuration settings, there are three places where the value of a key can be set: the service configuration package, the application manifest, and the application parameters file. Service Fabric will always choose from the application parameters file first (if specified), then the application manifest, and finally the configuration package.

### Application parameter files

The Service Fabric application project can include one or more application parameter files, each of which defines the specific values for the parameters defined in the application manifest:

    <!-- ApplicationParameters\Local.xml -->

    <Application Name="fabric:/Application1" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric">
        <Parameters>
            <Parameter Name ="Stateful1_MinReplicaSetSize" Value="2" />
            <Parameter Name="Stateful1_PartitionCount" Value="1" />
            <Parameter Name="Stateful1_TargetReplicaSetSize" Value="3" />
        </Parameters>
    </Application>

By default, a new application includes two parameters files, named Local.xml and Cloud.xml:

![Application parameters files in Solution Explorer][app-parameters-solution-explorer]

To create a new parameters file, simply copy and past an existing one and give it a new name.

## Identifying environment-specific parameters during deployment

At deployment time, you need to choose the appropriate parameters file to apply with your application. You can do this through the Publish dialog in Visual Studio or in PowerShell.

### Deploying from Visual Studio

You can choose from the list of available parameters files when publishing your application in Visual Studio.

![Choose a parameters file in the Publish dialog][publishdialog]

### Deploying from PowerShell

The `DeployCreate-FabricApplication.ps1` PowerShell script accepts an parameters file as a paramater.

    ./DeployCreate-FabricApplication -ApplicationPackagePath <app_package_path> -ApplicationDefinitionFilePath <app_instance_definition_path>
