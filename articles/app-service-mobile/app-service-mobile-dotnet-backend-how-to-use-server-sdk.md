# Work with the .NET backend server SDK for Azure Mobile Apps

This topic shows you how to use the .NET backend server SDK in key Azure App Service Mobile Apps scenarios. The Azure Mobile Apps SDK helps you work with mobile clients from your ASP.NET application.

>[AZURE.TIP] The [.NET server SDK for Azure Mobile Apps](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-apps-net-server) is open source on GitHub. The repository contains the entire server SDK unit test suite as well as some sample projects.

## How to: Create a .NET backend for your mobile application

If you are starting a new project, you can create an App Service application using either the [Azure Preview Management Portal] or Visual Studio. This section will help you use one of these to create a new mobile application backend which hosts a simple todo list API. You can run this locally or publish the project to your cloud-based App Service mobile app.

If you are adding mobile capabilities to an existing project, see the [Download and initialize the SDK](#install-sdk) section below.

### Create a .NET backend using the Azure portal

You can create a new mobile application right in the [Azure Preview Management Portal]. You can either follow the steps below, or create a new client and server together by following the [Create a mobile app](app-service-mobile-ios-get-started.md) tutorial.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-create-new-service](../../includes/app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-create-new-service.md)]

&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Back in the _Get started_ blade, under **Create a table API**, choose **C#** as your **Backend language**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Click Download, extract the compressed project files to your local computer, and open the solution in Visual Studio.

### Create a .NET backend using Visual Studio 2013 and Visual Studio 2015

In order to create a Mobile Apps project in Visual Studio, you will need to install the [Azure SDK for .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/), version 2.8.1 or later. Once you have installed the SDK, create a new ASP.NET application:

1. Open the **New Project** dialog (from *File* > **New** > **Project...**).

2. Expand **Templates** > **Visual C#**, and select **Web**.

3. Select **ASP.NET Web Application**.

4. Fill in the project name. Then click **OK**.

5. Under _ASP.NET 4.5.2 Templates_, select **Azure Mobile App**. Check **Host in the cloud** to create a new mobile app in the cloud to which you can publish this project.

6. Click **OK**. Your application will be created and appear in the Solution Explorer.

## <a name="install-sdk"></a>How to: Download and initialize the SDK

The SDK is available on [NuGet.org]. This package includes the base functionality required to get started using the SDK. To initialize the SDK, you need to perform actions on the **HttpConfiguration** object. 

###Install the SDK

To install the SDK, right-click on the server project in Visual Studio, select **Manage NuGet Packages**, search for the [Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server/) package, then click **Install**.  

###<a name="server-project-setup"></a> Initialize the server project

A .NET backend server project is initialized similar to other ASP.NET projects, by including an OWIN startup class. To add this class in Visual Studio, right-click on your server project and select **Add** -> **New Item**, then **Web** -> **General** -> **OWIN Startup class**.

This will generate a class with the following attribute:

    [assembly: OwinStartup(typeof(YourServiceName.YourStartupClassName))]

In the `Configuration()` method of your OWIN startup class, set up the server project using an **HttpConfiguration** object which represents the configuration options for the service. The following example initialize the server project, with no added features: 

	// in OWIN startup class
	public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
	{
	    HttpConfiguration config = new HttpConfiguration();
	   
	    new MobileAppConfiguration()
	        // no added features
	        .ApplyTo(config);  
	    
	    app.UseWebApi(config);
	}

To enable individual features, you must call extension methods on the **MobileAppConfiguration** object before calling **ApplyTo**. For example, the following code adds the default routes to all API controllers during initialization:

	new MobileAppConfiguration()
	    .MapApiControllers()
	    .ApplyTo(config);

Many of the feature extension methods are available via additional NuGet packages you can include, which are described in the section below. 
The server quickstart from the Azure Portal calls **UseDefaultConfiguration()**. This equivalent to the following setup:
    
		new MobileAppConfiguration()
			.AddMobileAppHomeController()             // from the Home package
			.MapApiControllers()
			.AddTables(                               // from the Tables package
				new MobileAppTableConfiguration()
					.MapTableControllers()
					.AddEntityFramework()             // from the Entity package
				)
			.AddPushNotifications()                   // from the Notifications package
			.MapLegacyCrossDomainController()         // from the CrossDomain package
			.ApplyTo(config);


### SDK extensions

The following NuGet-based extension packages provide various mobile features that can be used by your application. You enable extensions during initialization by using the **MobileAppConfiguration** object.

- [Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Quickstart]  
	 Supports the basic Mobile Apps setup. Added to the configuration by calling the **UseDefaultConfiguration** extension method during initialization. This extension includes following extensions: Notifications, Authentication, Entity, Tables, Crossdomain and Home packages. This is equivalent to the quickstart server project that you download from the Azure portal.

- [Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Home](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Home/)   
	Implements the default *this mobile app is up and running page* for the web site root. Add to the configuration by calling the **AddMobileAppHomeController** extension method.

- [Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Tables](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Tables/)  
	includes classes for working with data and sets-up the data pipeline. Add to the configuration by calling the **AddTables** extension method.

- [Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Entity](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Entity/)   
	Enables the Entity Framework to access data in the SQL Database. Add to the configuration by calling the **AddTablesWithEntityFramework** extension method.

- [Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Authentication]  
	Enables authentication and sets-up the OWIN middleware used to validate tokens. Add to the configuration by calling the **AddAppServiceAuthentication** and **IAppBuilder**.**UseMobileAppAuthentication** extension methods.

- [Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Notifications]
	Enables push notifications and defines a push registration endpoint. Add to the configuration by calling the **AddPushNotifications** extension method.

- [Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.CrossDomain](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.CrossDomain/)  
	Creates a controller that serves data to legacy web browsers from your Mobile App. Add to the configuration by calling the **MapLegacyCrossDomainController** extension method.

- [Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Login] 
	 Provides preview support for custom authentication via the MobileAppLoginHandler.CreateToken() method. This is a static method and does not need to be enabled in the configuration.

## How to: Publish the server project

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-publish-service](../../includes/app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-publish-service.md)]

You can also use any of the other methods covered in the [Azure App Service deployment documentation](../app-service-web/web-site-deploy.md).

## How to: Define a table controller

A table controller provides access to entity data in a table-based data store, such as SQL Database or Azure Table storage. Table controllers inherit from the **TableController** generic class, where the generic type is an entity in the model that represents the table schema, as follows:

	public class TodoItemController : TableController<TodoItem>
    {  
		//...
	}

Table controllers are initialized by using the **AddTables** extension method. The following example initializes a table controller that uses Entity Framework for data access:

    new MobileAppConfiguration().AddTables(
        new MobileAppTableConfiguration()
        .MapTableControllers()
        .AddEntityFramework()).ApplyTo(config);
 
For an example of a table controller that uses Entity Framework to access data from an Azure SQL Database, see the **TodoItemController** class in the quickstart server project download from the Azure portal.


## How to: Define a custom API controller

The custom API controller provides the most basic functionality to your Mobile App backend by exposing an endpoint. The Custom API controller 

1. In Visual Studio, right-click the Controllers folder, then click **Add** > **Controller**, select **Web API 2 Controller&mdash;Empty** and click **Add**.

2. Supply a **Controller name**, such as `CustomController`, and click **Add**. This creates a new **CustomController** class that inherits from **ApiController**.   

3. In the new controller class file, add the following using statement:

		using Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Config;

4. Apply the **MobileAppControllerAttribute** to the API controller class definition, as in the following example:

		[MobileAppController] 
		public class CustomController : ApiController
		{
		      //...
		}

4. In App_Start/Startup.MobileApp.cs file, add a call to the  **MapApiControllers** extension method, as in the following example:

		new MobileAppConfiguration()
		    .MapApiControllers()
		    .ApplyTo(config);
    
	Note that you do not need to call **MapApiControllers** if you instead call **UseDefaultConfiguration**, which initializes all features. 

Any controller that does not have **MobileAppControllerAttribute** applied can still be accessed by clients, but it will not be correctly consumed by clients using any Mobile App client SDK. 


## How to: Add authentication to a server project

You can add authentication to your server project by extending the **MobileAppConfiguration** object and configuring OWIN middleware. When you install the [Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Quickstart] package and call the **UseDefaultConfiguration** extension method, you can skip to step 3.

1. In Visual Studio, install the [Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Authentication] package. 

2. In the Startup.cs project file, add the following line of code at the beginning of the **Configuration** method:

		app.UseMobileAppAuthentication(config);

	This adds the OWIN middleware component that enables your Azure Mobile App to validate tokens issued by the associated App Service gateway.

3. Add the `[Authorize]` attribute to any controller or method that requires authentication. Users must now be authenticated to access that endpoint or specific APIs.

To learn about how to authenticate clients to your Mobile Apps backend, see [Add authentication to your app](app-service-mobile-ios-get-started-users.md).

## <a name="custom-auth"></a>How to: Use custom authentication for your application

You can choose to provide your own login system if you do not wish to use one of the App Service Authentication/Authorization providers. To do so, install the [Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Login] package.

You will need to provide your own logic for determining if a user should be signed in. For example, you might check against salted and hashed passwords in a database. In the example below, the `isValidAssertion()` method is responsible for these checks and is defined elsewhere. 

The custom authentication is exposed by creating a new ApiController and exposing register and login actions like the one below. The client can attempt login by collecting the relevant information from the user and submitting an HTTPS POST to the API with the user information in the body. Once that information is validated, a token can be issued using the `MobileAppLoginHandler.CreateToken()` method. 

An example login action might be:

		public HttpResponseMessage Post([FromBody] JObject assertion)
		{
			if (isValidAssertion(assertion)) // user-defined function, checks against a database
			{
				JwtSecurityToken token = MobileAppLoginHandler.CreateToken(new Claim[] { new Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub, assertion["username"]) },
					mySigningKey,
					myAppURL,
					myAppURL,
					TimeSpan.FromHours(24) );
				return this.Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, new LoginResult()
				{
					AuthenticationToken = token.RawData,
					User = new LoginResultUser() { UserId = userName.ToString() }
				});
			}
			else // user assertion was not valid
			{
				return this.Request.CreateUnauthorizedResponse();
			}
		}

In the above, LoginResult and LoginResultUser are just simple objects exposing the properties shown. The client expects login responses to come back as JSON objects of the form:

		{
			"authenticationToken": "<token>",
			"user": {
				"userId": "<userId>"
			}
		}

The `MobileAppLoginHandler.CreateToken()` method includes an _audience_ and an _issuer_ parameter. Both of these are typically set to the URL of your application root, using the HTTPS scheme. Similarly you should set _secretKey_ to be the value of your application's signing key. This is a sensitive value that should never be shared or included in a client. You can obtain this value while hosted in App Service by referencing the _WEBSITE_AUTH_SIGNING_KEY_ environment variable. If needed in a local debugging context, follow the instructions in the [Local debugging with authentication](#local-debug) section to retrieve the key and store it as an application setting.

You also need to provide a lifetime for the issued token, as well as any claims you would like included. It is required that you provide a subject claim, as shown in the example code.

## How to: Add push notifications to a server project

You can add push notifications to your server project by extending the **MobileAppConfiguration** object and creating a Notification Hubs client. When you install the [Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Quickstart] package and call the **UseDefaultConfiguration** extension method, you can skip down to step 3.

1. In Visual Studio, right-click the server project and click **Manage NuGet Packages**, search for Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Notifications`, then click **Install**. This installs the [Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Notifications] package.
 
3. Repeat this step to install the `Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs` package, which includes the Notification Hubs client library. 

2. In App_Start/Startup.MobileApp.cs, and add a call to the **AddPushNotifications** extension method during initialization, which looks like the following:

		new MobileAppConfiguration()
			// other features...
			.AddPushNotifications()
			.ApplyTo(config);

	This creates the push notification registration endpoint in your server project. This endpoint is used by clients to register with the associated notification hub. Now you need to add the Notification Hub client that is used to send notifications.

3. In a controller from which you want to send push notifications, add the following using statement:

		using System.Collections.Generic;
		using Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs;

4. Add the following code that creates a Notification Hubs client:

        // Get the settings for the server project.
        HttpConfiguration config = this.Configuration;
        MobileAppSettingsDictionary settings = 
            config.GetMobileAppSettingsProvider().GetMobileAppSettings();
        
        // Get the Notification Hubs credentials for the Mobile App.
        string notificationHubName = settings.NotificationHubName;
        string notificationHubConnection = settings
            .Connections[MobileAppSettingsKeys.NotificationHubConnectionString].ConnectionString;

        // Create a new Notification Hub client.
        NotificationHubClient hub = NotificationHubClient
        .CreateClientFromConnectionString(notificationHubConnection, notificationHubName);

At this point, you can use the Notification Hubs client to send push notifications to registered devices. For more information, see [Add push notifications to your app](app-service-mobile-ios-get-started-push.md). To learn more about all that you can do with Notification Hubs, see [Notification Hubs Overview](../notification-hubs/notification-hubs-overview.md).

## How to: Add tags to a device installation to enable push-to-tags

Following the above **How to: Define a custom API controller**, you will want to set up a custom API on your backend to work with Notification Hubs to add tags to a specific device installation. Make sure you pass along the Installation ID stored on the client local storage and the tags you want to add (optional, since you can also specify tags directly on your backend). The following snippet should be added to your controller to work with Notification Hubs to add a tag to a device Installation ID.

Using [Azure Notification Hubs NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs/) ([reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt414893.aspx)):

		var hub = NotificationHubClient.CreateClientFromConnectionString("my-connection-string", "my-hub");

		hub.PatchInstallation("my-installation-id", new[]
		{
		    new PartialUpdateOperation
		    {
		        Operation = UpdateOperationType.Add,
		        Path = "/tags",
		        Value = "{my-tag}"
		    }
		});

To push to these tags, work with [Notification Hubs APIs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn495101.aspx).

You can also stand up your custom API to register device installations with Notification Hubs directly on your backend.

## How to: Debug and troubleshoot the .NET Server SDK

Azure App Service provides several debugging and troubleshooting techniques for ASP.NET applications:

- [Monitoring an Azure App Service](../app-service-web/web-sites-monitor.md)
- [Enable Diagnostic Logging in Azure App Service](../app-service-web/web-sites-enable-diagnostic-log.md)
- [Toubleshoot an Azure App Service in Visual Studio](../app-service-web/web-sites-dotnet-troubleshoot-visual-studio.md)

### Logging

You can write to App Service diagnostic logs by using the standard ASP.NET trace writing:

		ITraceWriter traceWriter = this.Configuration.Services.GetTraceWriter();
		traceWriter.Info("Hello, World");  

### <a name="local-debug"></a>Local debugging with authentication

You can run your application locally to test changes before publishing them to the cloud. For many apps, this is just a matter of pressing *F5* while in Visual Studio. However, there are some additional considerations when using authentication.

You must have a cloud-based mobile app with App Service Authentication/Authorization configured, and your client must have the cloud endpoint specified as the alternate login host. Please see the documentation for your chosen client platform ([iOS](app-service-mobile-ios-how-to-use-client-library.md), [Windows/Xamarin](app-service-mobile-dotnet-how-to-use-client-library.md)) for the specific steps required.

Ensure that your application has [Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Authentication] installed. Then, in your application's OWIN startup class, add the following, after `MobileAppConfiguration` has been applied to your `HttpConfiguration`:
		
		app.UseAppServiceAuthentication(new AppServiceAuthenticationOptions()
		{
			SigningKey = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["authSigningKey"],
			ValidAudiences = new[] { ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["authAudience"] },
			ValidIssuers = new[] { ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["authIssuer"] },
			TokenHandler = config.GetMobileAppTokenHandler()
		});

In the above example, you should configure the _authAudience_ and _authIssuer_ application settings within your Web.config file to each be the URL of your application root, using the HTTPS scheme. Similarly you should set _authSigningKey_ to be the value of your application's signing key. This is a sensitive value that should never be shared or included in a client. To obtain it, navigate to your app within the [Azure Preview Management Portal] and click **Tools**. Then select **Kudu** and click **Go**. This will take you to the Kudu management endpoint for your site. Click **Environment** and find the value under _WEBSITE_AUTH_SIGNING_KEY_. This is the value you should use for _authSigningKey_ in your local app config.

Your locally-running server is now equipped to validate tokens which the client obtains from the cloud-based endpoint.
