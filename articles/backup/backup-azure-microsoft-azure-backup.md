# Preparing to back up workloads to Microsoft Azure

> [AZURE.SELECTOR]
- [SCDPM](backup-azure-dpm-introduction.md)
- [Azure Backup](backup-azure-microsoft-azure-backup.md)

This article is about preparing your environment to back up workloads, so you can back up your data to Azure. With Microsoft Azure Backup server, you can protect application workloads such as Hyper-V VMs, Microsoft SQL Server, SharePoint Server, Microsoft Exchange and Windows clients to:

- **Disk** (D2D), giving high RTOs for tier 1 workloads
- **Azure** (D2D2C) for long term retention

And, you can manage the protection of various protected entities (servers and clients) from a single on-premises user interface.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Microsoft Azure Backup server inherits the functionality of Data Protection Manager (DPM) for workload backup. You will find pointers to DPM documentation for some of these capabilities. However Microsoft Azure Backup Server does not provide protection on tape or integrate with System Center. 

You can deploy Microsoft Azure Backup server as:

- A physical standalone server.
- A Hyper-V virtual machine - You can run Microsoft Azure Backup Server as a virtual machine hosted on an on-premises Hyper-V host server to back up on-premises data. For a list of considerations in this environment see [Install DPM as a virtual machine on an on-premises Hyper-V server](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn440941.aspx).
- A Windows virtual machine in VMWare - You can deploy Microsoft Azure Backup Server to provide protection for Microsoft workloads running on Windows virtual machines in VMWare. In this scenario Microsoft Azure Backup Server can be deployed as a physical standalone server, as a Hyper-V virtual machine, or as a Windows virtual machine in VMWare.
- An Azure virtual machine - You can run Microsoft Azure Backup Server as a virtual machine in Azure to back up cloud workloads running as Azure virtual machines. For information about this deployment see [Install DPM as an Azure virtual machine](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh758176.aspx).

Also,

- Microsoft Azure Backup can be installed on Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, 2012 and 2012 R2.
- Microsoft Azure Backup server cannot be installed on a machine which has the SCDPM or SCDPM RA agent installed.
- Microsoft Azure Backup server cannot be installed on a machine that has Microsoft Azure Backup agent installed and registered with an Azure Backup vault.



Once you select the server on which to install Microsoft Azure Backup, you need to:

- Ensure the Microsoft Azure Backup server prerequisites are met
- Create a Backup vault
- Download vault credentials, and
- Download Microsoft Azure Backup server setup files.

Each of these is explained in detail below.

## Before you start

Today, Microsoft Azure Backup server is available for the English locale only. Currently, Microsoft Azure Recovery Services is available in all geographies in which Azure is available other than Microsoft Azure Government datacenter and Microsoft Azure in China.

For a smooth installation, ensure the following prerequisites are met before installing Microsoft Azure backup server.

- The server should have connectivity to Internet. Microsoft Azure should be accessible by the server.
- Server requirements for installing Microsoft Azure Backup are the same as DPM. See these [hardware requirements](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn726764.aspx) for additional information.
- Microsoft Azure Backup server must be domain joined.
- Microsoft Azure Backup server must have .Net 3.5, .Net 4.0, .Net 3.5 SP1 features installed. See [more information regarding how to enable .Net Framework](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn482071.aspx) for additional information.
- Microsoft Azure Backup server should have Windows Management Framework 4.0 installed. You can download it [here](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40855).
- For the disk used as dedicated space for Microsoft Azure Backup Server data storage, the recommended storage pool size is 1.5 times the size of protected data. For more information, see the disks and storage section of [this topic](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh758176.aspx#DPM server).

<br>A: No.

### Microsoft Azure Backup server Connectivity to Azure service

Q: How does Microsoft Azure Backup server connectivity to Azure service and Azure subscription state affect backups and restore?
<br>A: Microsoft Azure Backup server requires connectivity to Azure service for the product to work successfully. At the same time, the Azure subscription needs to be in a healthy state.

The table below explains the functionality of Microsoft Azure Backup server with respect to different connectivity and Azure subscription states.

| Connectivity State | Azure Subscription | Backup to Azure| Backup to disk | Restore from Azure | Restore from disk |
| -------- | ------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Connected | Active | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed |
| Connected | Expired | Stopped | Stopped | Allowed | Allowed |
| Normal | Deprovisioned | Stopped | Stopped | Stopped and Azure recovery points deleted | Stopped |
| Lost connectivity > 15 days | Active | Stopped | Stopped | Allowed | Allowed |
| Lost connectivity > 15 days | Expired | Stopped | Stopped | Allowed | Allowed |
| Lost connectivity > 15 days | Deprovisioned | Stopped | Stopped |  Stopped and Azure recovery points deleted | Stopped |

Q: Assuming the subscription state continues to be *Active* what happens if Microsoft Azure Backup server connectivity is restored?
<br>A: Once Microsoft Azure Backup server connectivity to Azure service resumes as normal and the subscription state is *Active*, all operations of Microsoft Azure Backup server are allowed. Backups to both disk, as well as to Azure, will perform as normal.

Q: What happens if the subscription state is restored from an *Expired* state to an *Active* state?
<br>A: Assuming Microsoft Azure Backup server connectivity to the Azure service is normal, once the Microsoft Azure Backup server subscription state is restored to *Active*, all operations of Microsoft Azure Backup server are allowed. Backups to both disk, as well as to Azure, will now perform as normal.

Q: What happens if the subscription state is restored from a *Deprovisioned* state to an *Active* state?
<br>A: Assuming Microsoft Azure Backup server connectivity to the Azure service is normal, once the Microsoft Azure Backup server subscription state is restored to *Active*, all operations of Microsoft Azure Backup server are allowed. However, Azure recovery points get deleted and cannot be restored. Disk recovery points can be restored if the disk backups are in a valid retention range.

Q: What exceptions do I need to create for allowing Microsoft Azure Backup server connectivity to a public Azure service?
<br>A: You need to allow the following domain addresses in the firewall profile - www.msftncsi.com, \*.Microsoft.com, \*.WindowsAzure.com, \*.microsoftonline.com, \*.windows.net.

Q: How can I validate whether Microsoft Azure Backup server has connectivity to the Azure service?
<br>A: Execute the following PowerShell cmdlet in the Microsoft Azure Backup server console:

```
Get-DPMCloudConnection
Output:
TRUE - Connected to Azure service
FALSE - Not connected to Azure service
```

Q: Why is my subscription state not *Active*? How do I change it to *Active*?
<br>A: Log on to the [subscription portal]( https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) and manage your subscription.

### Billing

Q: What is the billing model for Microsoft Azure Backup server?
<br>A: Users will be billed via a protected instance model. For more information, refer to the FAQs on the [pricing](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/backup/) page.

Q: What is the billing model if I only protected data on disk?
<br>A: The billing model is the same as the protected instance model. Since this data is protected on on-premises storage there is no Azure storage charge for only disk-based backups. In this case only the protected instance fee would be billed to the customer. For more information about what defines an instance and how much is charged per instance, refer to the FAQs on the [pricing ](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/backup/) page.

Q: What is the charge per protected instance?
<br>A: Refer to the [pricing ](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/backup/) page.

Q: Where can I find examples that highlight different application workloads and the protected instance fee for them?
<br>A: Refer to the "Examples section" on the [pricing ](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/backup/) page.

Q: How would Microsoft Azure Backup server bill for a datasource which is protected on disk as well as cloud?
<br>A: Regardless of whether data is backed up to disk or cloud, Microsoft Azure backup server would charge based on protected instances. Protected instance size is calculated based on the front end size of the datasource. For backup data in Azure storage, Azure storage costs also apply.
