# Migrating a SQL Server database to Azure SQL Database

Moving your on-premises database to Azure SQL Database varies in complexity based on your database and application design, and your tolerance for downtime. For compatible databases, migration to Azure SQL Database is a straightforward schema and data movement operation requiring few, if any, changes to the schema and little or no re-engineering of applications. [Azure SQL Database V12](../sql-database-v12-whats-new.md) brings near-complete engine compatibility with SQL Server 2014 and SQL Server 2016. Most SQL Server 2016 Transact-SQL statements are fully supported in Microsoft Azure SQL Database. This includes the SQL Server data types, operators, and the string, arithmetic, logical, cursor functions, and the other Transact-SQL elements that most applications depend upon. Partially or unsupported functions are usually related to differences in how SQL Database manages the database (such as file, high availability, and security features) or for special purpose features such as service broker. Because SQL Database isolates many features from dependency on the master database, many server-level activities are inappropriate and unsupported. Features deprecated in SQL Server are generally not supported in SQL Database. Databases and applications that rely on [partially or unsupported functions](../sql-database-transact-sql-information.md) will need some re-engineering before they can be migrated.

The workflow for migrating a SQL Server database to Azure SQL Database are:

 1. [Determine if your database is compatible](#determine-if-your-database-is-compatible)
 2. [If not compatible, fix database compatibility issues](#fix-database-compatibility-issues)
 3. [Migrate a compatible database](#options-to-migrate-a-compatible-database-to-azure-sql-database)

>[AZURE.NOTE] To migrate other types of databases, including Microsoft Access, Sybase, MySQL Oracle, and DB2 to Azure SQL Database, see [SQL Server Migration Assistant](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ssma/).

## Determine if your database is compatible
There are two primary methods to use to determine if your source database is compatible.
- Export Data Tier Application: This method uses a wizard in Management Studio to analyze your database and displays database compatibility issues, if any,  on the console.
- SQLPackage: This method uses the SQLPackage.exe [sqlpackage.exe](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh550080.aspx) command-line utility to analyze your database and generate a report. SQLPackage ships with Visual Studio and SQL Server.

> [AZURE.NOTE] There is a third method that will uses trace files as additional source information to test for compatibility at the application level as well as at the database level. This is the [SQL Azure Migration wizard](http://sqlazuremw.codeplex.com/), a free tool on Codeplex. However, this tool currently may find compatibility errors that were issues for Azure SQL Database V11 that are not issues for Azure SQL Database V12.

If database incompatibilities are detected, you must fix these incompatibilities before you can migrate your database to Azure SQL Database. For guidance on how to fix database compatibility issues, go to [fix database compatibility issues](#fix-database-compatibility-issues).

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] These options do not catch all of the compatibility issues between different levels of SQL Server databases (i.e. level 90, 100, and 110). If you are migrating from an older database (level 80, 90, 100, and 110), you should go through the upgrade process first (at least in the dev environment) and once on SQL Server 2014 or later, then migrate to Azure SQL Database.

## Determine if your database is compatible using sqlpackage.exe

1. Open a command prompt and change a directory containing the newest version of sqlpackage.exe. This utility ships with both Visual Studio and SQL Server. You can also [download](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt204009.aspx) the latest version of SQL Server Data Tools to get this utility.
2. Execute the following sqlpackage.exe command with the following arguments for your environment:

	'sqlpackage.exe /Action:Export /ssn:< server_name > /sdn:< database_name > /tf:< target_file > /p:TableData=< schema_name.table_name > > < output_file > 2>&1'

	| Argument  | Description  |
	|---|---|
	| < server_name >  | source server name  |
	| < database_name >  | source database name  |
	| < target_file >  | file name and location for BACPAC file  |
	| < schema_name.table_name >  | the tables for which data will be output to the target file  |
	| < output_file >  | the file name and location for the output file with errors, if any  |

	The reason for the /p:TableName argument is that we only want to test for database compability for export to Azure SQL DB V12 rather than export the data from all tables. Unfortunately, the export argument for sqlpackage.exe does not support extracting no tables, so you will need to specify a single small table. The < output_file > will contain the report of any errors. The "> 2>&1" string pipes both the standard output and the standard error resulting from the command execution to specified output file.

	![Export a data-tier application from the Tasks menu](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/TestForCompatibilityUsingSQLPackage01.png)

3. Open the output file and review the compatibility errors, if any. For guidance on how to fix database compatibility issues, go to [fix database compatibility issues](#fix-database-compatibility-issues).

	![Export a data-tier application from the Tasks menu](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/TestForCompatibilityUsingSQLPackage02.png)

## Determine if your database is compatible using Export Data Tier Application

1. Verify that you have version 13.0.600.65 or later of SQL Server Management Studio. New versions of Management Studio are updated monthly to remain in sync with updates to the Azure portal.

 	 > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Download the [latest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238290.aspx) version of SQL Server Management Studio. It is recommended that you always use the latest version of Management Studio.

2. Open Management Studio and connect to your source database in Object Explorer.
3. Right-click the source database in the Object Explorer, point to **Tasks**, and click **Export Data-Tier Applicationâ€¦**

	![Export a data-tier application from the Tasks menu](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/TestForCompatibilityUsingSSMS01.png)

4. In the export wizard, click **Next**, and then on the **Settings** tab, configure the export to save the BACPAC file to either a local disk location or to an Azure blob. A BACPAC file will only be saved if you have no database compatibility issues. If there are compatibility issues, they will be displayed on the console.

	![Export settings](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/TestForCompatibilityUsingSSMS02.png)

5. Click the **Advanced tab** and clear the **Select All** checkbox to skip exporting data. Our goal at this point is only to test for compatibility.

	![Export settings](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/TestForCompatibilityUsingSSMS03.png)

6. Click **Next** and then click **Finish**. Database compatibility issues, if any, will appear after the wizard validates the schema.

	![Export settings](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/TestForCompatibilityUsingSSMS04.png)

7. If no errors appear, your database is compatible and you are ready to migrate. If you have errors, you will need to fix them. To see the errors, click **Error** for **Validating schema**. For how to fix these errors, go to [fix database compatibility issues](#fix-database-compatibility-issues).

	![Export settings](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/TestForCompatibilityUsingSSMS05.png)

8.	If the *.BACPAC file is successfully generated, then your database is compatible with SQL Database, and you are ready to migrate.

## Options to migrate a compatible database to Azure SQL Database

After you have verified that you have a compatible database, you need to choose your migration method. First, you need to decide if you can afford to take the database out of production during the migration. If not, use SQL Server transaction replication - which is discussed below. If you can afford some downtime or you are performing a test migration of your production database that you may later choose to migrate using transactional replication, consider one of the following three methods.

### Migrating a compatible database with downtime   
The following list discusses the options for migrating a compatible database to Azure SQL Database when you can afford to take some downtime while the migration is occurring and before you point your users and applications to the migrated database in Azure SQL Database. With these methods, you are migrating your database as it exists at a certain point in time.

> [AZURE.WARNING] Before migrating your database using any of these methods, ensure that no active transactions are occurring to ensure transactional consistency during the migration. There are many methods to quiesce a database, from disabling client connectivity to creating a [database snapshot](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms175876.aspx).

- For small to medium databases, migrating a [compatible](#determine-if-your-database-is-compatible) SQL Server 2005 or later database is as simple as running the [Deploy Database to Microsoft Azure Database Wizard](#use-the-deploy-database-to-microsoft-azure-database-wizard) in SQL Server Management Studio. If you have connectivity challenges (no connectivity, low bandwidth, or timeout issues), you can [use a BACPAC to migrate](#use-a-bacpac-to-migrate-a-database-to-azure-sql-database) a SQL Server database to Azure SQL Database.
- For medium to large databases or when you have connectivity challenges, [use a BACPAC to migrate](#use-a-bacpac-to-migrate-a-database-to-azure-sql-database) a SQL Server database to Azure SQL Database. With this method, you use SQL Server Management Studio to export the data and schema to a [BACPAC](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee210546.aspx#Anchor_4) file (stored locally or in an Azure blob) and then import the BACPAC file into your Azure SQL instance. If you store the BACPAC in an Azure blob, you can also import the BACPAC file from within the [Azure portal](sql-database-import.md) or [using PowerShell](sql-database-import-powershell.md).
- For larger databases, you will achieve the best performance by migrating the schema and the data separately. With this method, create a [BACPAC file with no data](#use-a-bacpac-to-migrate-a-database-to-azure-sql-database) and import this BACPAC into Azure SQL Database. After the schema has been imported into Azure SQL Database, you then use [BCP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms162802.aspx) to extract the data into flat files and then import these files into Azure SQL Database.

### Migrating a compatible database with no downtime

When you need to cannot afford to remove your your SQL Server database from production while the migration is occurring, you can use SQL Server transactional replication as your migration solution. With transactional replication, all changes to your data or schema that happen between the moment you start migrating and the moment you complete the migration will show up in your Azure SQL Database. Once the migration is complete, you just need to change the connection string of your applications to point them to your Azure SQL Database instead of pointing them to your on premise database. Once transactional replication drains any changes left on your on-premises database and all your applications point to Azure DB, you can now safely uninstall replication leaving your Azure SQL Database as the production system.

 ![SeedCloudTR diagram](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/SeedCloudTR.png)


Transactional replication is a technology built-in and integrated with SQL Server since SQL Server 6.5. It is a very mature and proven technology that most of DBAs know with which they have experience. With the [SQL Server 2016 preview](http://www.microsoft.com/server-cloud/products/sql-server-2016/), it is now possible to configure your Azure SQL Database as a [transactional replication subscriber](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt589530.aspx) to your on-premises publication. The experience that you get setting it up from Management Studio is exactly the same as if you set up a transactional replication subscriber on an on-premises server. Support for this scenario is supported with the following SQL Server versions:

 - SQL Server 2016 CTP3 (preview) and above 
 - SQL Server 2014 SP1 CU3 and above
 - SQL Server 2014 RTM CU10 and above
 - SQL Server 2012 SP2 CU8 and above
 - SQL Server 2013 SP3 when it will release

You can also use transactional replication to migrate a subset of your on-premises database. The publication that you replicate to Azure SQL Database can be limited to a subset of the tables in the database being replicated. Additionially, for each table being replicated, you can limit the data to a subset of the rows and/or a subset of the columns.

## Use Deploy Database to Microsoft Azure Database Wizard

The Deploy Database to Microsoft Azure Database wizard in SQL Server Management Studio migrates a migrating a [compatible](#determine-if-your-database-is-compatible) SQL Server 2005 or later database directly to your Azure SQL logical server instance.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The steps below assume that you have already [provisioned](../sql-database-get-started.md) your Azure SQL logical instance and have the connection information on hand.

1. Verify that you have version 13.0.600.65 or later of SQL Server Management Studio. New versions of Management Studio are updated monthly to remain in sync with updates to the Azure portal.

	 > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Download the [latest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238290.aspx) version of SQL Server Management Studio. It is recommended that you always use the latest version of Management Studio.

2. Open Management Studio and connect to your source database in Object Explorer.
3. Right-click the source database in the Object Explorer, point to **Tasks**, and click **Deploy Database to Microsoft Azure SQL Databaseâ€¦**

	![Deploy to Azure from Tasks menu](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/MigrateUsingDeploymentWizard01.png)

4.	In the deployment wizard, click **Next**, and then click **Connect** to configure the connection to your Azure SQL Database server.

	![Deploy to Azure from Tasks menu](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/MigrateUsingDeploymentWizard002.png)

5. In the Connect to Server dialog box, enter your connection information to connect to your Azure SQL Database server.

	![Deploy to Azure from Tasks menu](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/MigrateUsingDeploymentWizard00.png)

5.	Provide the **New database name** for the database on Azure SQL DB, set the **Edition of Microsoft Azure SQL Database** (service tier), **Maximum database size**, **Service Objective** (performance level), and **Temporary file name** for the BACPAC file that this wizard creates during the migration process. See [Azure SQL Database service tiers](sql-database-service-tiers.md) for more information on service tiers and performance levels.

	![Export settings](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/MigrateUsingDeploymentWizard02.png)

6.	Complete the wizard to migrate the database. Depending on the size and complexity of the database, deployment may take from a few minutes to many hours.
7.	Using Object Explorer, connect to your migrated database in your Azure SQL Database server.
8.	Using the Azure Portal, view your database and its properties.

## Use a BACPAC to Migrate a SQL Server Database to Azure SQL Database

For medium to large databases or when you have connectivity challenges, you can separate the migration process into two discrete steps. You can export of the schema and its data into a [BACPAC](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee210546.aspx#Anchor_4) file using one or two methods.

- [Export to a BACPAC file using SQL Server Management Studio](#export-a-compatible-sql-server-database-to-a-bacpac-file-using-sql-server-management-studio)
- [Export to a BACPAC using SqlPackage](#export-a-compatible-sql-server-database-to-a-bacpac-file-using-sqlpackage)

You can store this BACPAC locally or in an Azure blob. You can then import this BACPAC file into Azure SQL Database using one of several methods.

- [Import from a BACPAC file into Azure SQL Database using SQL Server Management Studio](#import-from-a-bacpac-file-into-azure-sql-database-using-sql-server-management-studio)
- [Import from a BACPAC file into Azure SQL Database using SqlPackage](#import-from-a-bacpac-file-into-azure-sql-database-using-sqlpackage)
- [Import from a BACPAC file into Azure SQL Database using the Azure portal](sql-database-import.md)
- [Import from a BACPAC file into Azure SQL Database using or PowerShell](sql-database-import-powershell.md)

## Export a compatible SQL Server database to a BACPAC file using SQL Server Management Studio

Use the steps below to use Management Studio to export a migrating a [compatible](#determine-if-your-database-is-compatible) SQL Server database to a BACPAC file.

1. Verify that you have version 13.0.600.65 or later of SQL Server Management Studio. New versions of Management Studio are updated monthly to remain in sync with updates to the Azure portal.

	 > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Download the [latest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238290.aspx) version of SQL Server Management Studio. It is recommended that you always use the latest version of Management Studio.

2. Open Management Studio and connect to your source database in Object Explorer.

	![Export a data-tier application from the Tasks menu](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/MigrateUsingBACPAC01.png)

3. Right-click the source database in the Object Explorer, point to **Tasks**, and click **Export Data-Tier Applicationâ€¦**

	![Export a data-tier application from the Tasks menu](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/TestForCompatibilityUsingSSMS01.png)

4. In the export wizard, configure the export to save the BACPAC file to either a local disk location or to an Azure blob. The exported BACPAC always includes the complete database schema and, by default, data from all the tables. Use the Advanced tab if you want to exclude data from some or all of the tables. You might, for example, choose to export only the data for reference tables rather than from all tables.

	![Export settings](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/MigrateUsingBACPAC02.png)

## Export a compatible SQL Server database to a BACPAC file using SqlPackage

Use the steps below to use the [SqlPackage.exe](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh550080.aspx) command line utility to export a migrating a [compatible](#determine-if-your-database-is-compatible) database to a BACPAC file.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The steps below assume that you have already provisioned an Azure SQL Database server, have the connection information on hand, and have verified that your source database is compatible.

## Fix database compatibility issues

If you determine that your source SQL Server database is not compatible, you have a number of options to fix the database compatibility issues that you [identified previously](#determine-if-your-database-is-compatible).

- Use the [SQL Azure Migration wizard](http://sqlazuremw.codeplex.com/). You can use this Codeplex tool to generate a T-SQL script from an incompatible source database that is then transformed by the wizard to make it compatible with the SQL Database and then connect to Azure SQL Database to execute the script. This tool will also analyze trace files to determine compatiblity issues. The script can be generated with schema only or can include data in BCP format. Additional documentation, including step-by-step guidance is available on Codeplex at [SQL Azure Migration wizard](http://sqlazuremw.codeplex.com/).  

 ![SAMW migration diagram](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/02SAMWDiagram.png)

 > [AZURE.NOTE] Note that not all incompatible schema that can be detected by the wizard can be processed by its built-in transformations. Incompatible script that cannot be addressed will be reported as errors, with comments injected into the generated script. If many errors are detected, use either Visual Studio or SQL Server Management Studio to step through and fix each error that could not be fixed using the SQL Server Migration Wizard.

- Use Visual Studio. You can use Visual Studio to import the database schema into a Visual Studio database project for analysis. To analyze, you specify the target platform for the project as SQL Database V12 and then build the project. If the build is successful, the database is compatible. If the build fails, you can resolve the errors in SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio ("SSDT"). Once the project builds successfully, you can publish it back as a copy of the source database and then use the data compare feature in SSDT to copy the data from the source database to the Azure SQL V12 compatible database. This updated database is then deployed to Azure SQL Database using the options [discussed previously](#options-to-migrate-a-compatible-database-to-azure-sql-database).

 ![VSSSDT migration diagram](./media/sql-database-cloud-migrate/03VSSSDTDiagram.png)

 > [AZURE.NOTE] If schema-only migration is required, the schema can be published directly from Visual Studio directly to Azure SQL Database. Use this method when the database schema requires more changes than can be handled by the migration wizard alone.

- SQL Server Management Studio. You can fix the issues in Management Studio using various Transact-SQL commands, such as **ALTER DATABASE**.
