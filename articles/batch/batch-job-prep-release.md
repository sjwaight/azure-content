# Run job preparation and completion tasks on Azure Batch compute nodes

Azure Batch jobs often require some form of setup prior to execution, and similarly, some sort of post-job maintenance after the job's tasks have completed. Batch provides the mechanisms for this preparation and maintenance in the form of optional *job preparation* and *job release* tasks.

The job preparation task runs on all compute nodes scheduled to run tasks, before any of a job's tasks run. Once the job has completed, the job release task runs on each node in the pool that executed at least one task. Both job preparation and release tasks allow you to specify a command line to run when the task is invoked, and offer features such as file download, elevated execution, custom environment variables, maximum execution duration, retry count, and file retention time.

In the following sections, you'll find out how to use these two special task types using the [JobPreparationTask][net_job_prep] and [JobReleaseTask][net_job_release] in the [Batch .NET][api_net] API.

> [AZURE.TIP] Job preparation and release tasks are especially helpful in "shared pool" environments--those environments in which a pool of compute nodes persists between job runs and is shared between many different jobs.

## When to use job preparation and release tasks

A number of situations benefit from job preparation and release tasks. Here are just a few:

- **Transfer of common task data** - Batch jobs often require a common set of data as input for the job's tasks. For example, in daily risk analysis calculations, market data is job-specific, yet common to all of the tasks in the job. This market data, often several gigabytes in size, should be downloaded to each compute node only once so each task that runs on a node can use it. Use a *job preparation task* to download the data to each node before the execution of other tasks.
- **Job data deletion** - Within a shared pool environment in which a pool's compute nodes are not decommissioned between jobs, deleting job data between runs might be needed to conserve disk space on the nodes or to satisfy an organization's security policies. Use a *job release task* to delete data downloaded by a job preparation task or generated during task execution.
- **Log retention** - You might want to keep a copy of log files generated by tasks, or perhaps crash dump files generated by failed applications. Use a *job release task* in such cases to compress and upload this data to an [Azure Storage][azure_storage] account.

## Job preparation task

Prior to the execution of a job's tasks, the job preparation task is executed on each compute node scheduled to run a task. By default, the Batch service will wait for the the job preparation task to complete before running the scheduled tasks on the node, but you can configure the service not to wait. The job preparation task will run again on a compute node if the node restarts, but you can also disable this behavior.

The job preparation task is only executed on nodes scheduled to run a task. This prevents the unnecessary execution of a preparation task should a node not be assigned a task, providing savings in data transfer charges, for example. This situation applies when the number of tasks for a job is less than the number of nodes in a pool, or when [concurrent task execution](batch-parallel-node-tasks.md) is enabled, leaving some nodes idle if the task count is lower than the total possible concurrent tasks.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The [JobPreparationTask][net_job_prep_cloudjob] differs from the [CloudPool.StartTask][pool_starttask] in that the JobPreparationTask executes at the start of each job, whereas the StartTask executes only when a compute node first joins a pool or restarts.

## Job release task

Once a job has completed, the job release task is executed on each node in the pool that executed at least one task. You mark a job as completed by issuing a terminate request. Then, the Batch service sets the job state to *terminating*, terminates any active or running tasks associated with the job, and runs the job release task. The job then moves to the *completed* state.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Job deletion also executes the job release task. However, if a job was previously terminated, the release task is not run a second time when that job is subsequently deleted.

## Job preparation and release tasks in Batch .NET

Specifying a job preparation task is done by creating and configuring a [JobPreparationTask][net_job_prep] and assigning it to your job's [CloudJob.JobPreparationTask][net_job_prep_cloudjob] property. Similarly, initialize a [JobReleaseTask][net_job_release] and assign it to your job's [CloudJob.JobReleaseTask][net_job_prep_cloudjob] property to set the job's release task.

In this code snippet, `myBatchClient` is a fully initialized instance of [BatchClient][net_batch_client], and `myPool` is an existing pool within the Batch account.

		// Create the CloudJob for CloudPool "myPool"
		CloudJob myJob = myBatchClient.JobOperations.CreateJob("JobPrepReleaseSampleJob",
															   new PoolInformation() { PoolId = "myPool" });

		// Specify the command lines for the job preparation and release tasks
		string jobPrepCmdLine = "cmd /c echo %AZ_BATCH_NODE_ID% > %AZ_BATCH_NODE_SHARED_DIR%\\shared_file.txt";
		string jobReleaseCmdLine = "cmd /c del %AZ_BATCH_NODE_SHARED_DIR%\\shared_file.txt";

		// Assign the job preparation task to the job
		myJob.JobPreparationTask = new JobPreparationTask { CommandLine = jobPrepCmdLine };

		// Assign the job release task to the job
		myJob.JobReleaseTask = new JobPreparationTask { CommandLine = jobReleaseCmdLine };

		await myJob.CommitAsync();

As mentioned above, the release task is executed when a job is terminated or deleted. Terminating a job with the Batch .NET API is performed by calling [PoolOperations.TerminateJobAsync][net_job_terminate], and job deletion is performed with [PoolOperations.DeleteJobAsync][net_job_delete], both of which are typically done when a job's tasks have completed or a timeout you have defined has been reached.

		// Terminate the job to mark it as Completed; this will initiate the Job Release Task on any node
		// that executed job tasks. Note that the Job Release Task is also executed when a job is deleted,
		// thus you need not call Terminate if you typically delete your jobs upon task completion.
		await myBatchClient.JobOperations.TerminateJobAsync("JobPrepReleaseSampleJob");

### Sample project on GitHub

Check out the [JobPrepRelease][job_prep_release_sample] sample project on GitHub to see job preparation and release tasks in action. This console application does the following:

1. Creates a pool with two "small" nodes
2. Creates a job with with job preparation, release, and standard tasks
3. Runs the job preparation task which first writes the node ID to a text file in a node's "shared" directory
4. Runs a task on each node that writes its task ID to the same text file
5. Once all tasks have completed (or the timeout is reached), prints the contents of each node's text file to the console
6. When the job is complete, runs the job release task to delete the file from the node
6. Prints the exit codes of the job preparation and release tasks for each node on which they executed
7. Pauses execution to allow confirmation of job and/or pool deletion

Output from the sample application is similar to the following:

```
Attempting to create pool: JobPrepReleaseSamplePool
The pool already existed when we tried to create it
Checking for existing job JobPrepReleaseSampleJob...
Job JobPrepReleaseSampleJob not found, creating...
Submitting tasks and awaiting completion...
All tasks completed.

### Inspect job preparation and release tasks with Batch Explorer

The [Batch Explorer][batch_explorer_article], also found in the Batch [sample code repository][batch_explorer_project] on GitHub, is an excellent tool to use when developing solutions with Azure Batch. When running the above sample application, for example, you can use the Batch Explorer to view the properties of the job and its tasks, or even download the shared text file modified by the job's tasks.

The screenshot below highlights the job preparation and release task properties shown in the Job Details pane when the *JobPrepReleaseSampleJob* job is selected in the Jobs tab.
