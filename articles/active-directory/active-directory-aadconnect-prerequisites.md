# Prerequisites for Azure Active Directory Connect (Azure AD Connect)
This topic describes the pre-requisites and the hardware requirements for Azure AD Connect.

## Before you install Azure AD Connect
Before you install Azure AD Connect, there are a few things that you will need.

**Azure AD**

- An Azure subscription or an [Azure trial subscription](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) - This is only required for accessing the Azure portal and not for using Azure AD Connect.  If you are using PowerShell or Office 365 you do not need an Azure subscription to use Azure AD Connect. If you have an Office 365 license you can also use the Office 365 portal. With a paid Office 365 license you can also get into the Azure portal from the Office 365 portal.
- Verify the domain you plan to use in Azure AD. For example if you plan to use contoso.com for your users then make sure this domain has been verified and you are not only using the contoso.onmicrosoft.com default domain.
- An Azure AD directory will by default allow 50k objects. When you verify the domain the limit will be increased to 300k objects. If you need even more objects in Azure AD you need to open a support case to have the limit increased even further. If you need more than 500k objects, you will need a license such as Office 365, Azure AD Basic, Azure AD Premium, or Enterprise Mobility Suite.

**On-premises servers and environment**

- The AD schema version and forest functional level must be Windows Server 2003 or later. The domain controllers can run any version as long as the schema and forest level requirements are met.
- If you plan to use the feature **password writeback** the Domain Controllers must be on Windows Server 2008 (with latest SP) or later.
- Azure AD Connect must be installed on Windows Server 2008 or later.  This server may be a domain controller or a member server if using express settings. If you use custom settings, the server can also be stand-alone and does not have to be joined to a domain.
- Azure AD Connect cannot be installed on Small Business Server or Windows Server Essentials. The server must be using Windows Server standard or better.
- If you plan to use the feature **password synchronization**, the server must be on Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 or later.
- If Active Directory Federation Services is being deployed, the servers where AD FS or Web Application Proxy will be installed must be Windows Server 2012 R2 or later. Windows remote management must be enabled on these servers for remote installation.
- Azure AD Connect requires a SQL Server database to store identity data. By default a SQL Server 2012 Express LocalDB (a light version of SQL Server Express) is installed and the service account for the service is created on the local machine. SQL Server Express has a 10GB size limit that enables you to manage approximately 100.000 objects. If you need to manage a higher volume of directory objects, you need to point the installation process to a different version of SQL Server.
Azure AD Connect supports all flavors of Microsoft SQL Server from SQL Server 2008 (with SP4) to SQL Server 2014.

**Accounts**

- An Azure AD Global Administrator account for the Azure AD directory you wish to integrate with.
- An Enterprise Administrator account for your local Active Directory if you use express settings or upgrade from DirSync.
- [Accounts is Active Directory](active-directory-aadconnect-accounts-permissions.md) if you use the custom settings installation path.

**Connectivity**

- If you are using an outbound proxy for connecting to the Internet, the following setting in the **C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\machine.config** file must be added for the installation wizard and Azure AD sync to be able to connect to the Internet and Azure AD.

```
    <system.net>
        <defaultProxy>
            <proxy
            usesystemdefault="true"
            proxyaddress="http://<PROXYADDRESS>:<PROXYPORT>"
            bypassonlocal="true"
            />
        </defaultProxy>
    </system.net>
```

This text must be entered at the bottom of the file.  In this code, &lt;PROXYADRESS&gt; represents the actual proxy IP address or host name.
- If your proxy limits which URLs which can be accessed then the URLs documented in [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges ](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2) must be opened in the proxy.

**Other**

- Optional:  A test user account to verify synchronization.

## Component prerequisites

Azure AD Connect depends on PowerShell and .Net 4.5.1. Depending on your Windows Server version, do the following:


- Windows Server 2012R2
  - PowerShell is installed by default, no action is required.
  - .Net 4.5.1 and later releases are offered through Windows Update. Make sure you have installed the latest updates to Windows Server in the Control Panel.
- Windows Server 2008R2 and Windows Server 2012
  - The latest version of PowerShell is available in **Windows Management Framework 4.0**, available on [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads).
  - .Net 4.5.1 and later releases are available on [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads).
- Windows Server 2008
  - The latest supported version of PowerShell is available in **Windows Management Framework 3.0**, available on [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads).
 - .Net 4.5.1 and later releases are available on [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads).

## Azure AD Connect supporting components

The following is a list of components that Azure AD Connect will install on the server where Azure AD Connect is installed. This list is for a basic Express installation.  If you choose to use a different SQL Server on the Install synchronization services page then SQL Express LocalDB is not installed locally.

- Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Command Line Utilities
- Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Native Client
- Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Express LocalDB
- Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell
- Microsoft Online Services Sign-In Assistant for IT Professionals
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistribution Package


## Hardware requirements for Azure AD Connect
The table below shows the minimum requirements for the Azure AD Connect sync computer.

| Number of objects in Active Directory | CPU | Memory | Hard drive size |
| ------------------------------------- | --- | ------ | --------------- |
| Fewer than 10,000 | 1.6 GHz | 4 GB | 70 GB |
| 10,000–50,000 | 1.6 GHz | 4 GB | 70 GB |
| 50,000–100,000 | 1.6 GHz | 16 GB | 100 GB |
| For 100,000 or more objects the full version of SQL Server is required|  |  |  |
| 100,000–300,000 | 1.6 GHz | 32 GB | 300 GB |
| 300,000–600,000 | 1.6 GHz | 32 GB | 450 GB |
| More than 600,000 | 1.6 GHz | 32 GB | 500 GB |

The minimum requirements for computers running AD FS or Web Application Servers is the following:

- CPU: Dual core 1.6 GHz or higher
- MEMORY: 2GB or higher
- Azure VM: A2 configuration or higher
