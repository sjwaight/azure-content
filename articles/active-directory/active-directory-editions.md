# Azure Active Directory editions

All Microsoft Online business services rely on Azure Active Directory for sign-on and other identity needs. If you subscribe to any of Microsoft Online business services (e.g. Office 365, Microsoft Azure, etc), you get Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with access to all of the Free features, described below.  

Azure Active Directory is a service that provides comprehensive identity and access management capabilities in the cloud for your employees, partners and customers. It combines directory services, advanced identity governance, a rich standards-based platform for developers, and application access management for your own or any of thousands of pre-integrated applications. With the Azure Active Directory Free edition, you can manage users and groups, synchronize with on-premises directories, get single sign-on across Azure, Office 365, and thousands of popular SaaS applications like Salesforce, Workday, Concur, DocuSign, Google Apps, Box, ServiceNow, Dropbox, and more. To learn more about Azure Active Directory, read [What is Azure AD](active-directory-whatis.md).


To enhance your Azure Active Directory, you can add paid capabilities using the Azure Active Directory Basic and Premium editions. Azure Active Directory paid editions are built on top of your existing free directory, providing enterprise class capabilities spanning self-service, enhanced monitoring, security reporting, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and secure access for your mobile workforce.

Office 365 subscriptions include additional Azure Active Directory features described in the comparison table below. 


> [AZURE.NOTE] For the pricing options of these editions, see [Azure Active Directory Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/active-directory/). <br>Azure Active Directory Premium and Azure Active Directory Basic are not currently supported in China.

[1] The 500k object limit does not apply for Office 365, Microsoft Intune or any other Microsoft online service that relies on Azure Active Directory for directory services.

[2] With Azure Active Directory Free and Azure Active Directory Basic, end users who have been assigned access to each SaaS app, can see up to 10 apps in their Access Panel and get SSO access to them (assuming they have first been configured with SSO by the admin). Admins can configure SSO and assign user access to as many SaaS apps as they want with Free, however end users will only see 10 apps in their Access Panel at a time.

[3] Microsoft Identity Manager Server software rights are granted with Windows Server licenses (any edition). Because Microsoft Identity Manager runs on the Windows Server operating system, as long as the server is running a valid, licensed copy of Windows Server, then Microsoft Identity Manager can be installed and used on that server. No other separate license is required for Microsoft Identity Manager Server.

[4] Azure AD paid features included with Office 365 are limited to use when accessing Office 365 applications only.

[5] Each of Microsoft's Online business Services, Office 365, Microsoft Intune, or any other Microsoft online service that relies on Azure Active Directory for directory services, carry their own service SLA which extends to their use of Azure Active Directory. To learn more, see [Microsoft online services SLA](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/online-SLA-ea09109e).
