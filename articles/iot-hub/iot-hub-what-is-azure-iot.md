## Next steps

You can use Azure IoT Hub, an Azure service that receives telemetry at scale from your devices and routes that data to a stream event processor, to implement your own solution back end. IoT Hub can also send cloud-to-device commands to specific devices. In addition, IoT Hub includes a device identity registry that you can use to provision devices and to manage which devices may connect to the hub. To learn more, see:

- [What is IoT Hub?][lnk-iot-hub]
- [Get started with IoT Hub][lnk-getstarted]

To implement client applications on a wide variety of device hardware platforms and operating systems, you can use the IoT device SDKs. The IoT device SDKs include libraries that facilitate sending telemetry to an IoT hub and receiving cloud-to-device commands. When you use the SDKs, you can choose from a number of network protocols to communicate with IoT Hub. To learn more, see [What are the device SDKs?][lnk-device-sdks].
