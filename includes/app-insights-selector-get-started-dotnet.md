[Visual Studio Application Insights](../article/application-insights/app-insights-overview.md) monitors your live application to help you [detect and diagnose performance issues and exceptions](../article/application-insights/app-insights-detect-triage-diagnose.md), and [discover how your app is used](../article/application-insights/app-insights-overview-usage.md).
